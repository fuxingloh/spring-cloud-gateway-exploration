## Cache Key Filter

To generate a consistent cache key to be used for read and write as path can be altered when passed through the filter
chain.

## Cache Read Filter

1. Run before NettyRoutingFilter
2. Get BinaryStream from redis
3. If cached; `setAlreadyRouted(exchange)` set buffer to exchange attribute for CacheHitFilter
4. If empty; `chain.filter(exchange)` and continue to NettyRoutingFilter.

It was `Mono<byte[]>` which mean it has to retain and read all into memory I was expecting `Flux<SomeBuffer>`, and when
the first signal indicate it's cached to publish upstream immediately.

## Cache Miss Filter

1. Run before NettyWriteResponseFilter
2. Modified HttpResponse to intercept `writeWith`
3. If already cached, pass through and ignore
4. Else, `Flux.publish().autoConnect(2)` to share the connection with 2 subscriber
5. `Mono.zip` to wrap both connection, so they get pulled together.
6. First connection write to `super.writeWith`
7. Second connection write to redis client.

## Cache Hit Filter

1. Same order as NettyWriteResponseFilter
2. Defer and get Buffer from exchange.
3. Write buffer to response

## Hypothesis and Conclusion

> Correct me if I am wrong.

The example here is non-blocking but not truly flux reactive in that sense.

The redis libraries (lettuce and reddison) that I have explored and dug into the source code both exposed Mono instead
of Flux. The idea was to stream the byte buffer directly from up to down and down to up without retaining any at memory.
This will greatly reduce any backpressure on the system as there is no wait and everything is passed along reactively.
Although spring gateway design allow non-blocking, the oddities of cache client is another story.
